## 📖 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm building this repository to organize my collection of **Computer Organization and Architecture** books. This is my personal library where I'm tracking the books I'm reading to understand how computers work at the hardware level.


## 🎯 What I'm Learning

I'm diving deep into these topics:

- **Basic Computer Organization**: Understanding CPU, Memory, and I/O
- **Instruction Sets**: Learning about RISC vs CISC architectures
- **Processor Design**: Exploring pipelining, superscalar, and out-of-order execution
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Studying cache, RAM, and virtual memory
- **I/O Systems**: Understanding buses, interrupts, and DMA
- **Assembly Language**: Getting hands-on with low-level programming
- **Computer Arithmetic**: Working with integer and floating-point operations
- **Digital Logic**: Building knowledge of gates, circuits, and logic design

## 📝 My Repository Structure
